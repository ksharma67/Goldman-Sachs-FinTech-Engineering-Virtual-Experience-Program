## Overview: Crack leaked password database

Your job is to crack as many passwords as possible with available tools (e.g. use Hashcat). Here are your Task instructions:

```bash
1. Review the links provided in the additional resources (section 4) below to gain a background understanding of password cracking

2. Try to crack the passwords provided in the 'password dump' file below using available tools

3. Assess the 5 questions in the task instructions below in relation to the passwords provided (type of hashing algorithm, level of protection, possible controls that could be implemented, password policy, changes in policy)

4. Draft an email/memo briefly explaining your findings in relation to controls used by the organization and your proposed uplifts. We recommend spending about 1.5 hours on this task and keeping it at 1 page in length

```

Your answer should be provided in the form of a draft email/memo explaining your findings and conclusions of controls currently used by an organization to prevent successful cracking of passwords and potential uplifts that you would propose to existing controls with justifications.
